# viSRA
**v**isualization of **SRA**: This tool takes SRR-Gene alignments from deSRA (https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/deSRA) and uses them as input to the AicroArrayPipeline's (https://github.com/CCBR/MicroArrayPipeline) analysis and visualization modules.

## Introduction
The future of biomedical research depends on the ability to rapidly access and analyze Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data stored at the NCBIâ€™s Sequence Read Archive (SRA). NGS provides an unprecedented level of resolution, allowing researchers to ask previously unanswerable questions such as how cancer pathogenesis might be mediated by very small changes in gene expression.


With ~3 million records currently stored in the SRA database, and submissions growing exponentially, the SRA collection represents a treasure-trove of data to be mined by academia and industry. The information contained in a single SRA dataset is equivalent to hundreds of in vitro experiments worth of work, potentially saving thousands of dollars and research hours.


Here we present viSRA, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq data from SRA datasets on the fly. There are a variety of tools to analyize and visualize microarray data, and these can be leveraged to accelerate development of feature rich RNA-Seq tools. viSRA facilitates the interrogation of SRA datasets for differential gene expression via dockerized pipeline. viSRA makes it easy for biologists to perform pathway enrichment analyses and to interrogate which genes are differentially expressed between experiments. viSRA benefits greatly from previous work on deSRA and the MicroArrayPipeline
